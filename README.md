## Overview


## Description

## Setup

### Requirements

* Puppet Enterprise 3.8 or greater
* [Azure gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/azure) 0.7.0 or greater

### Installing the Azure module

1. Install the required gems with this command:

   ~~~
   /opt/puppet/bin/gem install azure hocon --no-ri --no-rdoc
   ~~~

   If you are running Puppet Enterprise 2015.2.0 you need to use the
updated path:

   ~~~
   /opt/puppetlabs/puppet/bin/gem install azure hocon --no-ri --no-rdoc
   ~~~

2. Set the following environment variables specific to your Azure
   installation:

   ~~~
   export AZURE_MANAGEMENT_CERTIFICATE='/path/to/pem/file'
   export AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID='your-subscription-id'
   ~~~

   Alternatively, you can provide the information in a configuration file. Store this as azure.conf in the relevant [confdir](https://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppet/latest/reference/dirs_confdir.html). This should be:

   * nix Systems: /etc/puppetlabs/puppet
   * Windows: C:\ProgramData\PuppetLabs\puppet\etc
   * non-root users: ~/.puppetlabs/etc/puppet

   The file format is:

   ~~~
   azure: {
     subscription_id: "your-subscription-id"
     management_certificate: "/path/to/pem/file"
   }
   ~~~

   Note that you can use either the environment variables or the config file. If both are present the environment variables will be used. You cannot have some settings in environment variables and others in the config file.

3. Finally install the module with:

   ~~~
   puppet module install puppetlabs-msazure
   ~~~


## Usage

You can create Azure Virtual Machines using the following:

~~~
azure_vm { 'virtual-machine-name':
  ensure           => present,
  image            => 'b39f27a8b8c64d52b05eac6a62ebad85__Ubuntu-14_04_2-LTS-amd64-server-20150706-en-us-30GB',
  location         => 'West US',
  user             => 'username',
  private_key_file => '/path/to/private/key',
}
~~~

In addition to describing new machines using the DSL the module also supports
listing and managing machines via `puppet resource`:

~~~
puppet resource azure_vm
~~~

Note that this will output some information about the machines in your
account:

~~~
azure_vm { 'virtual-machine-name':
  ensure => 'present',
  image  => 'b39f27a8b8c64d52b05eac6a62ebad85__Ubuntu-14_04_2-LTS-amd64-server-20150706-en-us-30GB',
}
~~~
