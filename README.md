## Description

TODO: Add brief description of what the module does.

## Setup

### Requirements

* Puppet Enterprise 3.8 or greater
* [Azure gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/azure) 0.7.0 or greater

### Getting Azure credentials

In order to use the Azure module, you'll need an Azure account. If you
already have one you can skip this section, but otherwise you can sign
up for a [Free Trial](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/).

You then need to install the Azure CLI. This is required to
generate the certificate that we will use later for the Puppet module,
but it's also a useful way of interacting with Azure. Follow this
[installation
guide](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/documentation/articles/xplat-cli-install/)
to get the CLI setup.

Next you need to register the CLI with your Azure account. You can do
this by following this [guide from
Microsoft](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/documentation/articles/xplat-cli-connect/).
The basic steps are:

~~~
azure account download
azure account import <path to your .publishsettings file>
~~~

When you have the account created, you can export the PEM certificate file
using the following command:

~~~
azure account cert export
~~~

And finally, you can get the subscription ID using the `account list` command
like so:

~~~
$ azure account list
info:    Executing command account list
data:    Name                    Id                                     Tenant Id  Current
data:    ----------------------  -------------------------------------  ---------  -------
data:    Pay-As-You-Go           xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxxx  undefined  true
info:    account list command OK
~~~

To use the Resource Manager API instead, you need a service
principal on the Active Directory. The official documentation covers [creating this and retrieving the required credentials](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/resource-group-authenticate-service-principal/).

### Installing the Azure module

1. Install the required gems with this command:

   ~~~
   /opt/puppet/bin/gem install azure hocon retries --no-ri --no-rdoc
   /opt/puppet/bin/gem install azure azure_mgmt_compute azure_mgmt_storage azure_mgmt_resources azure_mgmt_network hocon retries --no-ri --no-rdoc
   ~~~

   If you are running Puppet Enterprise 2015.2.0 [TODO: or later?], use the
updated path:

   ~~~
   /opt/puppetlabs/puppet/bin/gem install azure azure_mgmt_compute azure_mgmt_storage azure_mgmt_resources azure_mgmt_network  hocon retries --no-ri --no-rdoc
   ~~~

2. Set the following environment variables specific to your Azure
   installation:

   If using the Classic API, you need to provide:

   ~~~
   export AZURE_MANAGEMENT_CERTIFICATE='/path/to/pem/file'
   export AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID='your-subscription-id'
   ~~~

   If using the Resource Management API, you need to provide:

   ~~~
   export AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID='your-subscription-id'
   export AZURE_TENANT_ID='your-tenant-id'
   export AZURE_CLIENT_ID='your-client-id'
   export AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET='your-client-secret'
   ~~~

   Note that you can provide all of the above credentials if you are
   working with **both** Resource Manager and Classic virtual machines.

   Alternatively, you can provide the information in a configuration file. Store this as azure.conf in the relevant [confdir](https://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppet/latest/reference/dirs_confdir.html). This should be:

   * nix Systems: `/etc/puppetlabs/puppet`
   * Windows: `C:\ProgramData\PuppetLabs\puppet\etc`
   * non-root users: `~/.puppetlabs/etc/puppet`

   The file format is:

   ~~~
   azure: {
     subscription_id: "your-subscription-id"
     management_certificate: "/path/to/pem/file"
   }
   ~~~

   Or, with the Resource Management API:

   ~~~
   azure: {
     subscription_id: "your-subscription-id"
     tenant_id: 'your-tenant-id'
     client_id: 'your-client-id'
     client_secret: 'your-client-secret'
   }
   ~~~

   Note that you can use either the environment variables or the config file. If both are present, the environment variables are used. You cannot have some settings in environment variables and others in the config file.

3. Finally, install the module with:

   ~~~
   puppet module install puppetlabs-msazure
   ~~~


## Usage

### Create Azure VMs

You can create Azure Virtual Machines using the following:

~~~
azure_vm_classic { 'virtual-machine-name':
  ensure           => present,
  image            => 'b39f27a8b8c64d52b05eac6a62ebad85__Ubuntu-14_04_2-LTS-amd64-server-20150706-en-us-30GB',
  location         => 'West US',
  user             => 'username',
  size             => 'Medium',
  private_key_file => '/path/to/private/key',
}
~~~

### List and manage VMs

In addition to describing new machines using the DSL, the module also supports
listing and managing machines via `puppet resource`:

~~~
puppet resource azure_vm_classic
~~~

Note that this will output some information about the machines in your
account:

~~~
azure_vm_classic { 'virtual-machine-name':
  ensure        => 'present',
  cloud_service => 'cloud-service-uptjy',
  deployment    => 'cloud-service-uptjy',
  hostname      => 'garethr',
  image         => 'b39f27a8b8c64d52b05eac6a62ebad85__Ubuntu-14_04_2-LTS-amd64-server-20150706-en-us-30GB',
  ipaddress     => 'xxx.xx.xxx.xx',
  location      => 'West US',
  media_link    => 'http://xxx.blob.core.windows.net/vhds/disk_2015_08_28_07_49_34_868.vhd',
  os_type       => 'Linux',
  size          => 'Medium',
}
~~~

Azure management with azure_vm.

You can create an Azure Virtual Manchine with the Azure ARM API with the following :

~~~
azure_vm { 'sample':
  location                      => 'eastus',
  image                         => 'canonical:ubuntuserver:14.04.2-LTS:latest',
  user                          => 'azureuser',
  password                      => 'Password',
  size                          => 'Standard_A0',
  resource_group                => 'testresacc01',
  storage_account               => 'teststoracc01',
  storage_account_type          => 'Standard_GRS',
  os_disk_name                  => 'osdisk01',
  os_disk_caching               => 'ReadWrite',
  os_disk_create_option         => 'fromImage',
  os_disk_vhd_container_name    => 'conttest1',
  os_disk_vhd_name              => 'vhdtest1',
  dns_domain_name               => 'mydomain01',
  dns_servers                   => '10.1.1.1.1 10.1.2.4',
  public_ip_allocation_method   => 'Dynamic',
  public_ip_address_name        => 'ip_name_test01pubip',
  virtual_network_name          => 'vnettest01',
  virtual_network_address_space => '10.0.0.0/16',
  subnet_name                   => 'subnet111',
  subnet_address_prefix         => '10.0.2.0/24',
  ip_configuration_name         => 'ip_config_test01',
  private_ipallocation_method   => 'Dynamic',
  network_interface_name        => 'nicspec01',
}
~~~

In addition to describing new machines using the DSL the module also supports
listing and managing machines via `puppet resource`:

~~~
$ puppet resource azure_vm
azure_vm { 'sample':
  location         => 'eastus',
  image            => 'canonical:ubuntuserver:14.04.2-LTS:latest',
  user             => 'azureuser',
  password         => 'Password',
  size             => 'Standard_A0',
  resource_group   => 'testresacc01',
}
~~~


## Reference

### Types

* `azure_vm_classic`: Manages a virtual machine in Microsoft Azure.
* `azure_vm`: Manages a virtual machine in Microsoft Azure with ARM.

### Parameters

#### Type: azure_vm_classic

##### `ensure`

Specifies the basic state of the virtual machine. Valid values are 'present',
'running', stopped', and 'absent'. Defaults to 'present'.

Values have the following effects:

* 'present': Ensure that the VM exists in either the running or stopped
  state. If the VM doesn't yet exist, a new one is created.
* 'running': Ensures that the VM is up and running. If the VM
  doesn't yet exist, a new one is created.
* 'stopped': Ensures that the VM is created, but is not running. This
  can be used to shut down running VMs, as well as for creating VMs without
  having them running immediately.
* 'absent': Ensures that the VM doesn't exist on Azure.

##### `name`

*Required* The name of the virtual machine.

##### `image`

Name of the image to use to create the virtual machine. This can be either a VM Image or an OS Image. When specifying a VM Image, `user`, `password`, and `private_key_file` are not used.

The most often used endpoints are SSH for Linux and WinRM for Windows. Usually they are configured for direct pass-through like this:

~~~
endpoints => [{
    name        => 'ssh',
    local_port  => 22,
    public_port => 22,
    protocol    => 'TCP',
  },]
~~~

or

~~~
endpoints => [{
